# About this project

This project simulate an online store for musical instruments where users can search and add items to their carts. The items are split in multiple categories that also split in multiple subcategories, up to 5 level deep of subcategories. Users can search their desired items by either navigating through category/subcategory cards located on the home page or can use the search bar in the navbar.

The project was mainly meant to help me learn how to use typescript and react (which is why many questionable/dumb code might be present ) as well as many other things.
